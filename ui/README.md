# Calendo - An Interactive Calendar Application

Calendo is an event-driven digitial calendar for scheduling events. It was created with TypeScript and React, as a demonstration for integrating core application logic and performing various event-delegation with a composable, reactive UI, all on the client's browser.

## Purpose
Calendo is a 're-invention' of the wheel: It was an attempt to re-create core features of Google Calendar (point-and-click event creation, draggable events, etc.), and building it out with React. 

## Development
Calendo is built on top of create-react-app. To run Calendo locally, clone this repository and run
```
yarn
```
to download the necessary dependencies. Then run
```
yarn start
```
to build and serve a development-ready application locally.

## Upcoming Features & Changes

- [ ] URL-based sessions: Persist Calendar Events, accessible through unique URLs. 
- [ ] Export: Provide the ability to export your events to Google Calendar or iCloud Calendar.
